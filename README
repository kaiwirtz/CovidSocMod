The CovidSocMod code requires the package SiSi2.0. This package enables efficient management of simulations and numerical experiments by using a suite of formatted control files similar to a markup structure. SiSi2.0 facilitates file input and output operations. The software is available as an external part of the CovidSocMod package and needs to be compiled beforehand.


Installation:
-------------
Unpack SiSi2.0.tgz somewhere - preferably in the same subdirectory SiSi2.0 where the CovidSocMod sources lay. Build the library using "make lib", which should generate libsisi.a.

Adjust in the "Makefile" of CovidSocMod SISSIPATH to the directory where SiSi2.0 has been installed (if not the default location). The freshly generated "libsisi.a" should be in SISSIPATH/lib.
Adjust in "corona.sim" the ModelPath to the directory of the CovidSocMod sources.
If you keep	the relative path of result files (e.g., MovieResFile	"res/Res.outb") you need to create the corresponding directory (e.g., by "mkdir res").

Type "make" to compile and execute the model.
"make corona" only compiles; "make run" only executes.

Specific numeric experiments can be created by transforming "corona.sim" into new "*.sim" files which in turn link to  different control files. For example, you can switch from a single simulation to a systematic variation by changing the switch AnalysisType in "control.ctl" from 0 to 1. Or you can use an alternative parametrization by replacing "model.par" by, e.g, "model_new.par" where values of individual parameters were changed.
